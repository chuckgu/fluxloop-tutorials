- **Assistant**: {"transcript": [{"user": "Am i allowed to update my flight to something sooner? I want to leave later today.", "assistant": "I can help — first a quick clarification: do you mean you want to take an earlier flight than your booked LX0112 (i.e., depart sooner), or you want to leave later today (a later flight this evening)? Your message says both, so I want to be sure which one.\n\nA few important notes before we proceed:\n- I can check availability for other flights today and, if you want to change the booking, I’ll pass the request to our flight-change team to complete the rebooking (I can’t make the change myself).\n- Your ticket number starts with 724 (eligible for changes) and your booking is a single SWISS segment (CDG → BSL), so online rebooking is normally supported — but policies and cutoff times vary by departure airport.\n- Your current flight departs very soon (15:54 local). Because it’s only a few minutes until departure, online rebooking might already be blocked; in that case the fastest option is to speak to SWISS staff at the airport check-in or transfer desk.\n- Changes may incur a fare difference and/or change fees depending on your fare conditions (Economy). If the new flight is cheaper, online refunds for airport tax differences aren’t available.\n\nTell me:\n1) Do you want an earlier or a later flight today? If earlier, how much earlier (as soon as possible or a specific time)? If later, what time window is OK?\n2) Are you willing to pay any fare difference/fees if required?\n\nIf you want me to search flights for today now, I can do that and then—if you want to proceed—submit the change request for you. What would you like me to do?"}], "thread_id": "b8b2dc41-e260-4cf5-9d31-63d4368d65f6", "provider": "openai"} _(source=agent ; actions=agent:customer_support_session, span:prepare_travel_database, span:download_travel_database, span:refresh_travel_dates, span:fetch_user_flight_information, span:assistant_turn, span:lookup_policy, span:load_policy_retriever, span:policy_vector_query, span:assistant_turn, span:search_flights, span:assistant_turn)_
- **User**: Update my flight to sometime next week then _(source=supervisor ; persona=expert_user)_
- **Assistant**: {"transcript": [{"user": "Update my flight to sometime next week then", "assistant": "I can rebook you — I found SWISS-operated CDG→BSL options next week (all LX0112, departures 15:55 — arrivals 17:25). Please confirm which date you want or give permission for me to pick the earliest:\n\n- Flight ID 19251 — 2025-11-24 15:55 → 17:25\n- Flight ID 19238 — 2025-11-25 15:55 → 17:25\n- Flight ID 19242 — 2025-11-26 15:55 → 17:25\n- Flight ID 19259 — 2025-11-27 15:55 → 17:25\n- Flight ID 19243 — 2025-11-28 15:55 → 17:25\n- Flight ID 19280 — 2025-11-29 15:55 → 17:25\n\nImportant notes before I proceed:\n- Your ticket number (7240005432906569) is eligible for online rebooking in principle. The booking reference will stay the same but a new ticket number will be issued after rebooking.\n- Seat reservation, special meal and APIS details are normally preserved when rebooking.\n- Change fees and/or fare differences may apply. I can’t give an exact price until I try to rebook; it could be nothing (if your fare allows free changes) or it could be a fare difference plus a change fee. Tell me if you accept that I may need to charge/pay the fare difference and any change fee if required.\n- Because your original flight departs in a few minutes, there’s a small chance online change could be blocked if the system considers the booking checked-in/in-progress. If that happens, I’ll tell you and we’ll need to rebook at the airport counter or via the SWISS service center (I can escalate if you prefer).\n\nHow would you like to proceed?\n- Option A: Rebook to a specific date from the list above — tell me which Flight ID or date.\n- Option B: Rebook to the earliest available (19251 on 2025-11-24) and proceed now — I will attempt the change and report the exact fees.\n- Option C: I should wait for your preferred date/time or flexibility (e.g., “any day 24–27 Nov” or “I’m okay with connections via ZRH”).\n\nReply with your choice and whether you accept potential fare difference/change fees. If you want me to proceed now, I’ll attempt the rebooking."}], "thread_id": "544e9759-774f-40bf-a97d-0c03a66dca0b", "provider": "openai"} _(source=agent ; actions=agent:customer_support_session, span:prepare_travel_database, span:download_travel_database, span:refresh_travel_dates, span:fetch_user_flight_information, span:assistant_turn, span:lookup_policy, span:load_policy_retriever, span:policy_vector_query, span:assistant_turn, span:assistant_turn, span:search_flights, span:assistant_turn)_

That’s a convenient time to get into Basel city center before evening.\n\n- Getting from the airport to Basel city center\n  - Bus: Regular airport buses connect the terminal to Basel SBB (central train station). Journey time ~20–30 minutes depending on traffic. It’s usually the quickest and cheapest public option.\n  - Taxi / rideshare: Taxis are available outside the terminal; typical fare to central Basel is roughly in the 30–50 CHF/EUR range depending on traffic and exact destination.\n  - Train: There’s no direct train inside the terminal building — you’d take a bus to the nearest station (Basel SBB) to connect onward by rail.\n  - Car rental: Major suppliers operate at/near the airport (Avis, Europcar, Sixt, Hertz, etc.). Pickup desks or shuttle services are available; driving to Basel or surrounding regions is straightforward.\n\n- Hotel location choices\n  - Near the airport (Saint-Louis / EuroAirport area): convenient if you have an early flight or prefer minimal transit.\n  - Basel city center (Old Town, near Messe or Bahnhof): best for sightseeing, restaurants, nightlife. Travel time from airport ~20–30 minutes.\n  - Mulhouse / French side: sometimes more budget-friendly and still close by.\n\n- Example hotel types (to help narrow preferences)\n  - Luxury: riverside / historic hotels in Basel Old Town\n  - Mid-range: well-located business hotels near the station or Messe\n  - Budget: hostels, budget chains near Bahnhof or outskirts\n\nWhat I need from you to proceed\n- If you want me to search/book a hotel: check-in and check-out dates, number of guests/rooms, preferred location (airport vs city center), budget per night, any must-haves (breakfast, free cancellation, parking, accessibility).\n- If you want me to search/book a car: pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up location (airport), preferred car type (compact / sedan / SUV / automatic), driver age, any extras (child seat, GPS, additional driver).\n- If you only want recommendations or public-transport directions for a particular destination in Basel, tell me the address or neighborhood.\n\nWhich would you like me to do next — search hotels, search car rentals, or just give more detailed transport directions?"}], "thread_id": "53866cec-5f7d-4398-9e0a-31bcde4c4a22", "provider": "openai"} _(source=agent ; actions=agent:customer_support_session, span:prepare_travel_database, span:download_travel_database, span:refresh_travel_dates, span:fetch_user_flight_information, span:assistant_turn)_

Your message says both, so I want to be sure which one.\n\nA few important notes before we proceed:\n- I can check availability for other flights today and, if you want to change the booking, I’ll pass the request to our flight-change team to complete the rebooking (I can’t make the change myself).\n- Your ticket number starts with 724 (eligible for changes) and your booking is a single SWISS segment (CDG → BSL), so online rebooking is normally supported — but policies and cutoff times vary by departure airport.\n- Your current flight departs very soon (15:54 local). Because it’s only a few minutes until departure, online rebooking might already be blocked; in that case the fastest option is to speak to SWISS staff at the airport check-in or transfer desk.\n- Changes may incur a fare difference and/or change fees depending on your fare conditions (Economy). If the new flight is cheaper, online refunds for airport tax differences aren’t available.\n\nTell me:\n1) Do you want an earlier or a later flight today? If earlier, how much earlier (as soon as possible or a specific time)? If later, what time window is OK?\n2) Are you willing to pay any fare difference/fees if required?\n\nIf you want me to search flights for today now, I can do that and then—if you want to proceed—submit the change request for you. What would you like me to do?"

Your message says both, so I want to be sure which one.\n\nA few important notes before we proceed:\n- I can check availability for other flights today and, if you want to change the booking, I’ll pass the request to our flight-change team to complete the rebooking (I can’t make the change myself).\n- Your ticket number starts with 724 (eligible for changes) and your booking is a single SWISS segment (CDG → BSL), so online rebooking is normally supported — but policies and cutoff times vary by departure airport.\n- Your current flight departs very soon (15:54 local). Because it’s only a few minutes until departure, online rebooking might already be blocked; in that case the fastest option is to speak to SWISS staff at the airport check-in or transfer desk.\n- Changes may incur a fare difference and/or change fees depending on your fare conditions (Economy). If the new flight is cheaper, online refunds for airport tax differences aren’t available.\n\nTell me:\n1) Do you want an earlier or a later flight today? If earlier, how much earlier (as soon as possible or a specific time)? If later, what time window is OK?\n2) Are you willing to pay any fare difference/fees if required?\n\nIf you want me to search flights for today now, I can do that and then—if you want to proceed—submit the change request for you.

Please confirm which date you want or give permission for me to pick the earliest:\n\n- Flight ID 19251 — 2025-11-24 15:55 → 17:25\n- Flight ID 19238 — 2025-11-25 15:55 → 17:25\n- Flight ID 19242 — 2025-11-26 15:55 → 17:25\n- Flight ID 19259 — 2025-11-27 15:55 → 17:25\n- Flight ID 19243 — 2025-11-28 15:55 → 17:25\n- Flight ID 19280 — 2025-11-29 15:55 → 17:25\n\nImportant notes before I proceed:\n- Your ticket number (7240005432906569) is eligible for online rebooking in principle. The booking reference will stay the same but a new ticket number will be issued after rebooking.\n- Seat reservation, special meal and APIS details are normally preserved when rebooking.\n- Change fees and/or fare differences may apply. I can’t give an exact price until I try to rebook; it could be nothing (if your fare allows free changes) or it could be a fare difference plus a change fee. Tell me if you accept that I may need to charge/pay the fare difference and any change fee if required.\n- Because your original flight departs in a few minutes, there’s a small chance online change could be blocked if the system considers the booking checked-in/in-progress. If that happens, I’ll tell you and we’ll need to rebook at the airport counter or via the SWISS service center (I can escalate if you prefer).\n\nHow would you like to proceed?\n- Option A: Rebook to a specific date from the list above — tell me which Flight ID or date.\n- Option B: Rebook to the earliest available (19251 on 2025-11-24) and proceed now — I will attempt the change and report the exact fees.\n- Option C: I should wait for your preferred date/time or flexibility (e.g., “any day 24–27 Nov” or “I’m okay with connections via ZRH”).\n\nReply with your choice and whether you accept potential fare difference/change fees. If you want me to proceed now, I’ll attempt the rebooking."

However, there is a character limitation for this field.\n\t* Your first and middle name is stored by the system spelled together without spaces. This is not a mistake and does not affect your booking.\n\t* Any subsequent name changes, including adding names to a ticket, are not allowed.\n7. Is it possible to apply the changes only to some of the passengers in the same booking?\n\t* The changes will always be applied to all passengers travelling together.

Economy Light can only be booked on flights operated by SWISS (airline code LX). For technical reasons, seats cannot be reserved on codeshare flights for the time being.\n\nWhy doesn't SWISS offer an Economy Flex fare for groups?\nGroup bookings can be changed to any fare option free of charge until the time the ticket is issued provided that the same price is still available. The Economy Flex fare therefore does not provide an additional benefit for groups, and so we do not offer it.\n\nCan the additional options (advance seat reservation, additional baggage etc.) always be changed?\nThe additional options cannot be rebooked with Economy Light because the fare itself cannot be changed. With the Economy Classic fare, the additional options can only be booked on the same reservation.\n\nIs it possible to pay for an upgrade to Business Class with the Economy Light, Economy Classic and Economy Flex fares?\nWenn Sie einen Tarif Economy Light, Economy Classic oder Economy Flex gebucht haben, können Sie ein Upgrade in die Business Class buchen, das viele Leistungen der Business Class enthält.

All other status benefits, such as free lounge access, remain unchanged with this fare.\n\nWhat do SWISS Golf Traveller Club members need to consider when choosing a fare?\nIm Tarif Economy Light ist keine kostenlose Mitnahme von Golfgepäck möglich.\n\nWhat are the differences in the miles credits with the various fares?\nThe number of miles credited is still determined by the booking class.\n\nIf I have booked a Light fare and paid for an additional item of baggage and then cancel my flight, do I lose everything?\nLike the Ecnomy Light fare, the charge for the first item of paid baggage will not be reimbursed, nor can it be used for a different flight.\n\nIf I book an Economy Classic fare and travel without checked baggage, will I be reimbursed for the baggage not taken?\nNo; no refunds are given for any services included in a fare that are not used.\n\nWhat is the difference between the 1 st bag and the additional bag?\nThe 1 st bag can only be purchased with the Economy Light fare. It costs less than the additional item of baggage.\n\nWith the Economy Light fare, how can I purchase a 1 st bag (max. 23 kg) in addition?\nThe first 1 st bag in the Economy Light fare can be purchased through your travel agent, through swiss.com (up to 6 hours before departure), the SWISS Service Center (up to 24 hours before departure) or at the airport. The price at the airport will be higher than for purchasing in advance. The charge is due for each flight route.\n\nIf I am asked at the gate to check in my baggage, can I quickly purchase it online in order to benefit from the lower price?\nNo; you can only purchase it via swiss.com up to1 hour before departure. Different prices apply at the airport.\n\nHow many additional items of baggage can I purchase?\nYou can purchase a maximum of two additional items of baggage via swiss.com.

How can I change my booking?\n\t* The ticket number must start with 724 (SWISS ticket no./plate).\n\t* The ticket was not paid for by barter or voucher (there are exceptions to voucher payments; if the ticket was paid for in full by voucher, then it may be possible to rebook online under certain circumstances. If it is not possible to rebook online because of the payment method, then you will be informed accordingly during the rebooking process).\n\t* There must be an active flight booking for your ticket. It is not possible to rebook open tickets or tickets without the corresponding flight segments online at the moment.\n\t* It is currently only possible to rebook outbound (one-way) tickets or return tickets with single flight routes (point-to-point).\n2. Which tickets/bookings cannot be rebooked online currently?\n\t* Bookings containing flight segments with other airlines\n\t* Bookings containing reservations, where a ticket has not yet been issued\n\t* Bookings with several valid tickets for the same person and route\n\t* Tickets with a status other than O (open) (A)\n\t* Bookings with segments with a status other than OK (e.g. containing flight segments with the status Waitlist) (HK|RR)\n\t* Tickets that do not display the tariff calculation (IT tickets)\n\t* Bookings that contain special services (e.g. transportation of animals/transportation of medical equipment/transportation of special sporting equipment etc.)\n\t* Tickets that are part of a group booking\n\t* Tickets on which the booking class (RBD) does not correspond to the tariff code (FareBase)\n3. Am I allowed to make changes to my online redemption booking?\n\t* Redemption bookings can not yet be changed on swiss.com.\n4. What changes can I make on my ticket?\n\t* You can change the flight and the travel dates. Change of origin and destination or name changes are not possible online.\n5. After I have made changes to the itinerary online, can I make another change?\n\t* If the fare condition allows it, it is possible to make multiple changes to the itinerary.\n6. Can a name be changed after a booking is made?\n\t* The correct name(s) of the customer travelling need to be entered in a booking. The first and last name of the passenger travelling needs to be entered exactly as in the travel documents. Entering a middle name is optional and can be added in the first name field. However, there is a character limitation for this field.\n\t* Your first and middle name is stored by the system spelled together without spaces. This is not a mistake and does not affect your booking.\n\t* Any subsequent name changes, including adding names to a ticket, are not allowed.\n7. Is it possible to apply the changes only to some of the passengers in the same booking?\n\t* The changes will always be applied to all passengers travelling together. Changes to the passenger name or number of passengers is not possible online.\n8. Until what time before departure can a flight be rebooked online?\n\t* The minimum time before departure for online rebookings depends on your departure airport. If you are departing from a Swiss airport, then you can rebook online up to three hours before departure.\n9. Will any differences in airport taxes be refunded online, if the new flight choice is cheaper?\n\t* No, online refunds are currently not possible.\n10. Why isn't the rebooking made in the same currency as the ticket?\n\t* Any calculations associated with the rebooking will be made in the currency of the original country of departure (Point of Commencement).\n11. Will my seat reservation be taken into account in the rebooking?\n\t* Yes, your seat reservation will be included in the rebooking.\n12. Will my special meal be included in the rebooking?\n\t* Yes, your special meal will be included.\n13. Will my additional passenger details (APIS) be included in the rebooking?\n\t* Yes, your APIS details will be included.\n14. Will the travel insurance obtained from the Europäische Reiseversicherung (European Travel Insurance) through SWISS be included in the new ticket?\n\t* Yes, the travel insurance obtained through SWISS will be included in the new ticket and will remain valid.\n15. Will I be given a new booking reference after rebooking?\n\t* No, your booking reference will stay the same after rebooking.\n16. Will I be given a new ticket number after rebooking?\n\t* Yes, you will be given a new ticket number after rebooking.\n17. Can I change my booking after checking in online?\n\t* No, only tickets with the status \"Open\" can be changed online.\n18. I want to change a flight booking which is part of a package purchased with a Travel Agency. What do I need to consider?\n\t* The changes processed on swiss.com are limited to the flight booking only. No changes to any other service included in your package (e.g. hotel, rental car etc.) will be processed.\n19. I want to process an online change to a flight booking which was purchased with a Travel Agency. What do I need to consider?\n\t* You can change your flight booking online, but your Travel Agency will not have access to your new electronic ticket.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Frequently asked questions: European fare concept\nCan a particular Economy fare be fully booked?\nNo. As long as there are still seats in Economy Class, all three Economy fares will always be available in every available booking class .\n\nCan the SWISS fares be booked on codeshare flights operated by other airlines? What happens when changing a flight from a SWISS-operated flight to a codeshare flight (e.g. Zurich-Lisbon with TAP Portugal)?\nThe fares Economy Classic, Economy Flex and Business can be booked on codeshare flights. Economy Light can only be booked on flights operated by SWISS (airline code LX). For technical reasons, seats cannot be reserved on codeshare flights for the time being.\n\nWhy doesn't SWISS offer an Economy Flex fare for groups?\nGroup bookings can be changed to any fare option free of charge until the time the ticket is issued provided that the same price is still available. The Economy Flex fare therefore does not provide an additional benefit for groups, and so we do not offer it.\n\nCan the additional options (advance seat reservation, additional baggage etc.) always be changed?\nThe additional options cannot be rebooked with Economy Light because the fare itself cannot be changed. With the Economy Classic fare, the additional options can only be booked on the same reservation.\n\nIs it possible to pay for an upgrade to Business Class with the Economy Light, Economy Classic and Economy Flex fares?\nWenn Sie einen Tarif Economy Light, Economy Classic oder Economy Flex gebucht haben, können Sie ein Upgrade in die Business Class buchen, das viele Leistungen der Business Class enthält. Es ist via swiss.com oder dem SWISS Service Center buchbar.\n\nWhat do status customers (HON Circle Member, Senator, Frequent Traveller) need to consider when choosing a fare?\nTarif Economy Light does not include free advanced seat reservation or any additional baggage (e.g. golf equipment). All other status benefits, such as free lounge access, remain unchanged with this fare.\n\nWhat do SWISS Golf Traveller Club members need to consider when choosing a fare?\nIm Tarif Economy Light ist keine kostenlose Mitnahme von Golfgepäck möglich.\n\nWhat are the differences in the miles credits with the various fares?\nThe number of miles credited is still determined by the booking class.\n\nIf I have booked a Light fare and paid for an additional item of baggage and then cancel my flight, do I lose everything?\nLike the Ecnomy Light fare, the charge for the first item of paid baggage will not be reimbursed, nor can it be used for a different flight.\n\nIf I book an Economy Classic fare and travel without checked baggage, will I be reimbursed for the baggage not taken?\nNo; no refunds are given for any services included in a fare that are not used.\n\nWhat is the difference between the 1 st bag and the additional bag?\nThe 1 st bag can only be purchased with the Economy Light fare. It costs less than the additional item of baggage.\n\nWith the Economy Light fare, how can I purchase a 1 st bag (max. 23 kg) in addition?\nThe first 1 st bag in the Economy Light fare can be purchased through your travel agent, through swiss.com (up to 6 hours before departure), the SWISS Service Center (up to 24 hours before departure) or at the airport. The price at the airport will be higher than for purchasing in advance. The charge is due for each flight route.\n\nIf I am asked at the gate to check in my baggage, can I quickly purchase it online in order to benefit from the lower price?\nNo; you can only purchase it via swiss.com up to1 hour before departure. Different prices apply at the airport.\n\nHow many additional items of baggage can I purchase?\nYou can purchase a maximum of two additional items of baggage via swiss.com. If you are going through a travel agent, you can purchase a maximum of one 1 st bag plus one additional bag.if you go through the SWISS Service Center, there is no limit to the number of additional items of baggage you may purchase.\n\nSWISS Economy Flex: what does the “Change to earlier flight on the same day” service offer?\nApplies to \"Economy Flex\" and \"Business Flex\" fares. Rebooking free of charge is possible only on the day of departure during online check-in via lufthansa.com or the Lufthansa app, or at a check-in machine or check-in counter at the airport. Applies to direct flights only. A change of route or airline is not possible.\n\n\n",

How can I change my booking?\n\t* The ticket number must start with 724 (SWISS ticket no./plate).\n\t* The ticket was not paid for by barter or voucher (there are exceptions to voucher payments; if the ticket was paid for in full by voucher, then it may be possible to rebook online under certain circumstances. If it is not possible to rebook online because of the payment method, then you will be informed accordingly during the rebooking process).\n\t* There must be an active flight booking for your ticket. It is not possible to rebook open tickets or tickets without the corresponding flight segments online at the moment.\n\t* It is currently only possible to rebook outbound (one-way) tickets or return tickets with single flight routes (point-to-point).\n2. Which tickets/bookings cannot be rebooked online currently?\n\t* Bookings containing flight segments with other airlines\n\t* Bookings containing reservations, where a ticket has not yet been issued\n\t* Bookings with several valid tickets for the same person and route\n\t* Tickets with a status other than O (open) (A)\n\t* Bookings with segments with a status other than OK (e.g. containing flight segments with the status Waitlist) (HK|RR)\n\t* Tickets that do not display the tariff calculation (IT tickets)\n\t* Bookings that contain special services (e.g. transportation of animals/transportation of medical equipment/transportation of special sporting equipment etc.)\n\t* Tickets that are part of a group booking\n\t* Tickets on which the booking class (RBD) does not correspond to the tariff code (FareBase)\n3. Am I allowed to make changes to my online redemption booking?\n\t* Redemption bookings can not yet be changed on swiss.com.\n4. What changes can I make on my ticket?\n\t* You can change the flight and the travel dates. Change of origin and destination or name changes are not possible online.\n5. After I have made changes to the itinerary online, can I make another change?\n\t* If the fare condition allows it, it is possible to make multiple changes to the itinerary.\n6. Can a name be changed after a booking is made?\n\t* The correct name(s) of the customer travelling need to be entered in a booking. The first and last name of the passenger travelling needs to be entered exactly as in the travel documents. Entering a middle name is optional and can be added in the first name field. However, there is a character limitation for this field.\n\t* Your first and middle name is stored by the system spelled together without spaces. This is not a mistake and does not affect your booking.\n\t* Any subsequent name changes, including adding names to a ticket, are not allowed.\n7. Is it possible to apply the changes only to some of the passengers in the same booking?\n\t* The changes will always be applied to all passengers travelling together. Changes to the passenger name or number of passengers is not possible online.\n8. Until what time before departure can a flight be rebooked online?\n\t* The minimum time before departure for online rebookings depends on your departure airport. If you are departing from a Swiss airport, then you can rebook online up to three hours before departure.\n9. Will any differences in airport taxes be refunded online, if the new flight choice is cheaper?\n\t* No, online refunds are currently not possible.\n10. Why isn't the rebooking made in the same currency as the ticket?\n\t* Any calculations associated with the rebooking will be made in the currency of the original country of departure (Point of Commencement).\n11. Will my seat reservation be taken into account in the rebooking?\n\t* Yes, your seat reservation will be included in the rebooking.\n12. Will my special meal be included in the rebooking?\n\t* Yes, your special meal will be included.\n13. Will my additional passenger details (APIS) be included in the rebooking?\n\t* Yes, your APIS details will be included.\n14. Will the travel insurance obtained from the Europäische Reiseversicherung (European Travel Insurance) through SWISS be included in the new ticket?\n\t* Yes, the travel insurance obtained through SWISS will be included in the new ticket and will remain valid.\n15. Will I be given a new booking reference after rebooking?\n\t* No, your booking reference will stay the same after rebooking.\n16. Will I be given a new ticket number after rebooking?\n\t* Yes, you will be given a new ticket number after rebooking.\n17. Can I change my booking after checking in online?\n\t* No, only tickets with the status \"Open\" can be changed online.\n18. I want to change a flight booking which is part of a package purchased with a Travel Agency. What do I need to consider?\n\t* The changes processed on swiss.com are limited to the flight booking only. No changes to any other service included in your package (e.g. hotel, rental car etc.) will be processed.\n19. I want to process an online change to a flight booking which was purchased with a Travel Agency. What do I need to consider?\n\t* You can change your flight booking online, but your Travel Agency will not have access to your new electronic ticket.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Frequently asked questions: European fare concept\nCan a particular Economy fare be fully booked?\nNo. As long as there are still seats in Economy Class, all three Economy fares will always be available in every available booking class .\n\nCan the SWISS fares be booked on codeshare flights operated by other airlines? What happens when changing a flight from a SWISS-operated flight to a codeshare flight (e.g. Zurich-Lisbon with TAP Portugal)?\nThe fares Economy Classic, Economy Flex and Business can be booked on codeshare flights. Economy Light can only be booked on flights operated by SWISS (airline code LX). For technical reasons, seats cannot be reserved on codeshare flights for the time being.\n\nWhy doesn't SWISS offer an Economy Flex fare for groups?\nGroup bookings can be changed to any fare option free of charge until the time the ticket is issued provided that the same price is still available. The Economy Flex fare therefore does not provide an additional benefit for groups, and so we do not offer it.\n\nCan the additional options (advance seat reservation, additional baggage etc.) always be changed?\nThe additional options cannot be rebooked with Economy Light because the fare itself cannot be changed. With the Economy Classic fare, the additional options can only be booked on the same reservation.\n\nIs it possible to pay for an upgrade to Business Class with the Economy Light, Economy Classic and Economy Flex fares?\nWenn Sie einen Tarif Economy Light, Economy Classic oder Economy Flex gebucht haben, können Sie ein Upgrade in die Business Class buchen, das viele Leistungen der Business Class enthält. Es ist via swiss.com oder dem SWISS Service Center buchbar.\n\nWhat do status customers (HON Circle Member, Senator, Frequent Traveller) need to consider when choosing a fare?\nTarif Economy Light does not include free advanced seat reservation or any additional baggage (e.g. golf equipment). All other status benefits, such as free lounge access, remain unchanged with this fare.\n\nWhat do SWISS Golf Traveller Club members need to consider when choosing a fare?\nIm Tarif Economy Light ist keine kostenlose Mitnahme von Golfgepäck möglich.\n\nWhat are the differences in the miles credits with the various fares?\nThe number of miles credited is still determined by the booking class.\n\nIf I have booked a Light fare and paid for an additional item of baggage and then cancel my flight, do I lose everything?\nLike the Ecnomy Light fare, the charge for the first item of paid baggage will not be reimbursed, nor can it be used for a different flight.\n\nIf I book an Economy Classic fare and travel without checked baggage, will I be reimbursed for the baggage not taken?\nNo; no refunds are given for any services included in a fare that are not used.\n\nWhat is the difference between the 1 st bag and the additional bag?\nThe 1 st bag can only be purchased with the Economy Light fare. It costs less than the additional item of baggage.\n\nWith the Economy Light fare, how can I purchase a 1 st bag (max. 23 kg) in addition?\nThe first 1 st bag in the Economy Light fare can be purchased through your travel agent, through swiss.com (up to 6 hours before departure), the SWISS Service Center (up to 24 hours before departure) or at the airport. The price at the airport will be higher than for purchasing in advance. The charge is due for each flight route.\n\nIf I am asked at the gate to check in my baggage, can I quickly purchase it online in order to benefit from the lower price?\nNo; you can only purchase it via swiss.com up to1 hour before departure. Different prices apply at the airport.\n\nHow many additional items of baggage can I purchase?\nYou can purchase a maximum of two additional items of baggage via swiss.com. If you are going through a travel agent, you can purchase a maximum of one 1 st bag plus one additional bag.if you go through the SWISS Service Center, there is no limit to the number of additional items of baggage you may purchase.\n\nSWISS Economy Flex: what does the “Change to earlier flight on the same day” service offer?\nApplies to \"Economy Flex\" and \"Business Flex\" fares. Rebooking free of charge is possible only on the day of departure during online check-in via lufthansa.com or the Lufthansa app, or at a check-in machine or check-in counter at the airport. Applies to direct flights only. A change of route or airline is not possible.\n\n\n",

If no direct CDG->BSL on SWISS, include nearby convenient alternatives (e.g., via ZRH or other SWISS options) only if customer must travel that week. Check ticket eligibility for rebooking (ticket starts with 724), inform about possible fare difference and change fees, and whether online rebooking is allowed at this late time or whether this must be handled at airport/service center. Preserve seat, meal and APIS where possible and inform customer if new ticket number will be issued. If immediate rebooking is impossible due to imminent departure or check-in status, advise next steps (e.g., deny boarding, rebooking at airport counter) and attempt to secure next-week options. Please return available options, fees, and recommended next step, and any follow-up questions to ask the passenger (e.g., exact preferred dates/times, willingness to accept fare difference or connections)."

How can I change my booking?\n\t* The ticket number must start with 724 (SWISS ticket no./plate).\n\t* The ticket was not paid for by barter or voucher (there are exceptions to voucher payments; if the ticket was paid for in full by voucher, then it may be possible to rebook online under certain circumstances. If it is not possible to rebook online because of the payment method, then you will be informed accordingly during the rebooking process).\n\t* There must be an active flight booking for your ticket. It is not possible to rebook open tickets or tickets without the corresponding flight segments online at the moment.\n\t* It is currently only possible to rebook outbound (one-way) tickets or return tickets with single flight routes (point-to-point).\n2. Which tickets/bookings cannot be rebooked online currently?\n\t* Bookings containing flight segments with other airlines\n\t* Bookings containing reservations, where a ticket has not yet been issued\n\t* Bookings with several valid tickets for the same person and route\n\t* Tickets with a status other than O (open) (A)\n\t* Bookings with segments with a status other than OK (e.g. containing flight segments with the status Waitlist) (HK|RR)\n\t* Tickets that do not display the tariff calculation (IT tickets)\n\t* Bookings that contain special services (e.g. transportation of animals/transportation of medical equipment/transportation of special sporting equipment etc.)\n\t* Tickets that are part of a group booking\n\t* Tickets on which the booking class (RBD) does not correspond to the tariff code (FareBase)\n3. Am I allowed to make changes to my online redemption booking?\n\t* Redemption bookings can not yet be changed on swiss.com.\n4. What changes can I make on my ticket?\n\t* You can change the flight and the travel dates. Change of origin and destination or name changes are not possible online.\n5. After I have made changes to the itinerary online, can I make another change?\n\t* If the fare condition allows it, it is possible to make multiple changes to the itinerary.\n6. Can a name be changed after a booking is made?\n\t* The correct name(s) of the customer travelling need to be entered in a booking. The first and last name of the passenger travelling needs to be entered exactly as in the travel documents. Entering a middle name is optional and can be added in the first name field. However, there is a character limitation for this field.\n\t* Your first and middle name is stored by the system spelled together without spaces. This is not a mistake and does not affect your booking.\n\t* Any subsequent name changes, including adding names to a ticket, are not allowed.\n7. Is it possible to apply the changes only to some of the passengers in the same booking?\n\t* The changes will always be applied to all passengers travelling together. Changes to the passenger name or number of passengers is not possible online.\n8. Until what time before departure can a flight be rebooked online?\n\t* The minimum time before departure for online rebookings depends on your departure airport. If you are departing from a Swiss airport, then you can rebook online up to three hours before departure.\n9. Will any differences in airport taxes be refunded online, if the new flight choice is cheaper?\n\t* No, online refunds are currently not possible.\n10. Why isn't the rebooking made in the same currency as the ticket?\n\t* Any calculations associated with the rebooking will be made in the currency of the original country of departure (Point of Commencement).\n11. Will my seat reservation be taken into account in the rebooking?\n\t* Yes, your seat reservation will be included in the rebooking.\n12. Will my special meal be included in the rebooking?\n\t* Yes, your special meal will be included.\n13. Will my additional passenger details (APIS) be included in the rebooking?\n\t* Yes, your APIS details will be included.\n14. Will the travel insurance obtained from the Europäische Reiseversicherung (European Travel Insurance) through SWISS be included in the new ticket?\n\t* Yes, the travel insurance obtained through SWISS will be included in the new ticket and will remain valid.\n15. Will I be given a new booking reference after rebooking?\n\t* No, your booking reference will stay the same after rebooking.\n16. Will I be given a new ticket number after rebooking?\n\t* Yes, you will be given a new ticket number after rebooking.\n17. Can I change my booking after checking in online?\n\t* No, only tickets with the status \"Open\" can be changed online.\n18. I want to change a flight booking which is part of a package purchased with a Travel Agency. What do I need to consider?\n\t* The changes processed on swiss.com are limited to the flight booking only. No changes to any other service included in your package (e.g. hotel, rental car etc.) will be processed.\n19. I want to process an online change to a flight booking which was purchased with a Travel Agency. What do I need to consider?\n\t* You can change your flight booking online, but your Travel Agency will not have access to your new electronic ticket.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Frequently asked questions: European fare concept\nCan a particular Economy fare be fully booked?\nNo. As long as there are still seats in Economy Class, all three Economy fares will always be available in every available booking class .\n\nCan the SWISS fares be booked on codeshare flights operated by other airlines? What happens when changing a flight from a SWISS-operated flight to a codeshare flight (e.g. Zurich-Lisbon with TAP Portugal)?\nThe fares Economy Classic, Economy Flex and Business can be booked on codeshare flights. Economy Light can only be booked on flights operated by SWISS (airline code LX). For technical reasons, seats cannot be reserved on codeshare flights for the time being.\n\nWhy doesn't SWISS offer an Economy Flex fare for groups?\nGroup bookings can be changed to any fare option free of charge until the time the ticket is issued provided that the same price is still available. The Economy Flex fare therefore does not provide an additional benefit for groups, and so we do not offer it.\n\nCan the additional options (advance seat reservation, additional baggage etc.) always be changed?\nThe additional options cannot be rebooked with Economy Light because the fare itself cannot be changed. With the Economy Classic fare, the additional options can only be booked on the same reservation.\n\nIs it possible to pay for an upgrade to Business Class with the Economy Light, Economy Classic and Economy Flex fares?\nWenn Sie einen Tarif Economy Light, Economy Classic oder Economy Flex gebucht haben, können Sie ein Upgrade in die Business Class buchen, das viele Leistungen der Business Class enthält. Es ist via swiss.com oder dem SWISS Service Center buchbar.\n\nWhat do status customers (HON Circle Member, Senator, Frequent Traveller) need to consider when choosing a fare?\nTarif Economy Light does not include free advanced seat reservation or any additional baggage (e.g. golf equipment). All other status benefits, such as free lounge access, remain unchanged with this fare.\n\nWhat do SWISS Golf Traveller Club members need to consider when choosing a fare?\nIm Tarif Economy Light ist keine kostenlose Mitnahme von Golfgepäck möglich.\n\nWhat are the differences in the miles credits with the various fares?\nThe number of miles credited is still determined by the booking class.\n\nIf I have booked a Light fare and paid for an additional item of baggage and then cancel my flight, do I lose everything?\nLike the Ecnomy Light fare, the charge for the first item of paid baggage will not be reimbursed, nor can it be used for a different flight.\n\nIf I book an Economy Classic fare and travel without checked baggage, will I be reimbursed for the baggage not taken?\nNo; no refunds are given for any services included in a fare that are not used.\n\nWhat is the difference between the 1 st bag and the additional bag?\nThe 1 st bag can only be purchased with the Economy Light fare. It costs less than the additional item of baggage.\n\nWith the Economy Light fare, how can I purchase a 1 st bag (max. 23 kg) in addition?\nThe first 1 st bag in the Economy Light fare can be purchased through your travel agent, through swiss.com (up to 6 hours before departure), the SWISS Service Center (up to 24 hours before departure) or at the airport. The price at the airport will be higher than for purchasing in advance. The charge is due for each flight route.\n\nIf I am asked at the gate to check in my baggage, can I quickly purchase it online in order to benefit from the lower price?\nNo; you can only purchase it via swiss.com up to1 hour before departure. Different prices apply at the airport.\n\nHow many additional items of baggage can I purchase?\nYou can purchase a maximum of two additional items of baggage via swiss.com. If you are going through a travel agent, you can purchase a maximum of one 1 st bag plus one additional bag.if you go through the SWISS Service Center, there is no limit to the number of additional items of baggage you may purchase.\n\nSWISS Economy Flex: what does the “Change to earlier flight on the same day” service offer?\nApplies to \"Economy Flex\" and \"Business Flex\" fares. Rebooking free of charge is possible only on the day of departure during online check-in via lufthansa.com or the Lufthansa app, or at a check-in machine or check-in counter at the airport. Applies to direct flights only. A change of route or airline is not possible.\n\n\n",

The booking reference will stay the same but a new ticket number will be issued after rebooking.\n- Seat reservation, special meal and APIS details are normally preserved when rebooking.\n- Change fees and/or fare differences may apply. I can’t give an exact price until I try to rebook; it could be nothing (if your fare allows free changes) or it could be a fare difference plus a change fee. Tell me if you accept that I may need to charge/pay the fare difference and any change fee if required.\n- Because your original flight departs in a few minutes, there’s a small chance online change could be blocked if the system considers the booking checked-in/in-progress. If that happens, I’ll tell you and we’ll need to rebook at the airport counter or via the SWISS service center (I can escalate if you prefer).\n\nHow would you like to proceed?\n- Option A: Rebook to a specific date from the list above — tell me which Flight ID or date.\n- Option B: Rebook to the earliest available (19251 on 2025-11-24) and proceed now — I will attempt the change and report the exact fees.\n- Option C: I should wait for your preferred date/time or flexibility (e.g., “any day 24–27 Nov” or “I’m okay with connections via ZRH”).\n\nReply with your choice and whether you accept potential fare difference/change fees. If you want me to proceed now, I’ll attempt the rebooking.",

(If you want me to book, I can handle one type at a time — hotel or car — and I’ll ask the details I need.)\n\nQuick overview and practical options from EuroAirport (BSL):\n\n- Arrival and context\n  - Your flight (LX0112) arrives at BSL on 2025-11-17 at about 17:27 (local). That’s a convenient time to get into Basel city center before evening.\n\n- Getting from the airport to Basel city center\n  - Bus: Regular airport buses connect the terminal to Basel SBB (central train station). Journey time ~20–30 minutes depending on traffic. It’s usually the quickest and cheapest public option.\n  - Taxi / rideshare: Taxis are available outside the terminal; typical fare to central Basel is roughly in the 30–50 CHF/EUR range depending on traffic and exact destination.\n  - Train: There’s no direct train inside the terminal building — you’d take a bus to the nearest station (Basel SBB) to connect onward by rail.\n  - Car rental: Major suppliers operate at/near the airport (Avis, Europcar, Sixt, Hertz, etc.). Pickup desks or shuttle services are available; driving to Basel or surrounding regions is straightforward.\n\n- Hotel location choices\n  - Near the airport (Saint-Louis / EuroAirport area): convenient if you have an early flight or prefer minimal transit.\n  - Basel city center (Old Town, near Messe or Bahnhof): best for sightseeing, restaurants, nightlife. Travel time from airport ~20–30 minutes.\n  - Mulhouse / French side: sometimes more budget-friendly and still close by.\n\n- Example hotel types (to help narrow preferences)\n  - Luxury: riverside / historic hotels in Basel Old Town\n  - Mid-range: well-located business hotels near the station or Messe\n  - Budget: hostels, budget chains near Bahnhof or outskirts\n\nWhat I need from you to proceed\n- If you want me to search/book a hotel: check-in and check-out dates, number of guests/rooms, preferred location (airport vs city center), budget per night, any must-haves (breakfast, free cancellation, parking, accessibility).\n- If you want me to search/book a car: pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up location (airport), preferred car type (compact / sedan / SUV / automatic), driver age, any extras (child seat, GPS, additional driver).\n- If you only want recommendations or public-transport directions for a particular destination in Basel, tell me the address or neighborhood.\n\nWhich would you like me to do next — search hotels, search car rentals, or just give more detailed transport directions?"

(If you want me to book, I can handle one type at a time — hotel or car — and I’ll ask the details I need.)\n\nQuick overview and practical options from EuroAirport (BSL):\n\n- Arrival and context\n  - Your flight (LX0112) arrives at BSL on 2025-11-17 at about 17:27 (local). That’s a convenient time to get into Basel city center before evening.\n\n- Getting from the airport to Basel city center\n  - Bus: Regular airport buses connect the terminal to Basel SBB (central train station). Journey time ~20–30 minutes depending on traffic. It’s usually the quickest and cheapest public option.\n  - Taxi / rideshare: Taxis are available outside the terminal; typical fare to central Basel is roughly in the 30–50 CHF/EUR range depending on traffic and exact destination.\n  - Train: There’s no direct train inside the terminal building — you’d take a bus to the nearest station (Basel SBB) to connect onward by rail.\n  - Car rental: Major suppliers operate at/near the airport (Avis, Europcar, Sixt, Hertz, etc.). Pickup desks or shuttle services are available; driving to Basel or surrounding regions is straightforward.\n\n- Hotel location choices\n  - Near the airport (Saint-Louis / EuroAirport area): convenient if you have an early flight or prefer minimal transit.\n  - Basel city center (Old Town, near Messe or Bahnhof): best for sightseeing, restaurants, nightlife. Travel time from airport ~20–30 minutes.\n  - Mulhouse / French side: sometimes more budget-friendly and still close by.\n\n- Example hotel types (to help narrow preferences)\n  - Luxury: riverside / historic hotels in Basel Old Town\n  - Mid-range: well-located business hotels near the station or Messe\n  - Budget: hostels, budget chains near Bahnhof or outskirts\n\nWhat I need from you to proceed\n- If you want me to search/book a hotel: check-in and check-out dates, number of guests/rooms, preferred location (airport vs city center), budget per night, any must-haves (breakfast, free cancellation, parking, accessibility).\n- If you want me to search/book a car: pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up location (airport), preferred car type (compact / sedan / SUV / automatic), driver age, any extras (child seat, GPS, additional driver).\n- If you only want recommendations or public-transport directions for a particular destination in Basel, tell me the address or neighborhood.\n\nWhich would you like me to do next — search hotels, search car rentals, or just give more detailed transport directions?",
