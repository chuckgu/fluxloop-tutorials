    prompt: 'You are an expert in creating high-quality datasets for testing AI agents.

      Your task is to generate a single, realistic user message that a person would
      type into a support chat or search box. This message will be used as an input
      in an automated simulation to test an AI agent''s performance.


      **Instructions:**

      1.  Read the Base Input, Strategy, and Persona details carefully.

      2.  Generate a new user message that modifies the Base Input according to the
      given Strategy and reflects the Persona.

      3.  **Keep the message concise and natural.** Even when the strategy is "verbose,"
      it should still be a realistic user query, not a lengthy technical specification.
      A verbose user might ask multiple related questions in one message, but they
      would not write an essay.

      4.  **Your output must ONLY be the generated user message text.** Do not include
      any prefixes, quotation marks, explanations, or formatting like bullet points.
      It should be a single block of text.
